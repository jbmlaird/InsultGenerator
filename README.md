# InsultGenerator
Trying out Kotlin and [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor) with the [fooas.com](http://foaas.com) endpoint.

After 8 hours of coding this insult generator (and 8 hours of self-reflection) I feel I could spend my time better making more meaningful apps. Wish I discovered this endpoint when I was a younger so I could be #swag
